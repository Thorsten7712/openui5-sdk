<div class="body"><p class="p">The SAPUI5 framework has built-in support for modularizing comprehensive JavaScript applications.
			That means, instead of defining and loading one large bundle of JavaScript code, an
			application can be splitted into smaller parts which then can be loaded at runtime at
			the time when they are needed. These smaller individual files are called
				<dfn class="term">modules</dfn>. </p>
<p class="p">To load a module, the 
		<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp>
		function must be used. Assume the following page: 
	 </p>
<div><pre class="pre codeblock">

    &lt;!-- UI5 bootstrap tag --&gt;
    &lt;script id="sap-ui-bootstrap" src="./resources/sap-ui-core.js" data-sap-ui-libraries="sap.ui.commons"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;script&gt;
        jQuery.sap.require("sap.ui.commons.MessageBox");

        function onPressButton() {
            sap.ui.commons.MessageBox.alert("Hello World!");
        }

    &lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>
<p class="p">At first, the SAPUI5 framework initializes and then loads the
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.commons.MessageBox</samp> module. Internally, the framework
			analyzes the module name and derives the module URL from it: </p>
<div><pre class="pre codeblock">    ./resources/sap/ui/commons/MessageBox.js</pre></div>
<p class="p">The module script is then loaded from that URL and
		executed.

<div class="section" id="loio91f23a736f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_AEAD343584944C74AF7F7C45E87C395B"><div class="section_title">What is a Module</div><div type="What is a Module"> 
		 
		<p class="p">A module simply is a JavaScript file that can be loaded and executed in a browser. There are no
				rules or definitions what code belongs to a module, and what code does <strong class="ph b">not</strong>.
				It is up to the developer what content to bundle into a single module. But
				typically, the content of a module has some topic in common. Either it forms a
				JavaScript class or namespace, or the contained functions address a specific topic,
				for example client to server communication, mathematical functions, and so on.</p>
 
		<p class="p">There is also no special syntax or structure
		  defined for modules. However, there are some features that module developers
		  should be aware of and that they can use: 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Name</strong>: A module is loaded by calling <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp> with the name of
				the module. So, all modules are identified by a name. Human readers often associate
				a module with the main JavaScript object declared in it. Therefore, the module names
				by convention are a hierarchical sequence of dot-separated identifiers (like
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Core</samp>). It is best practice to use all but the last
				identifier to group modules in a logical and/or organizational way (much like
				packages in Java) and to use the last identifier to give the module a meaningful,
				semantical name, for example, the 'topic' common to the code in the module. </p>
 
		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Declaration</strong>: Modules can declare themselves by calling the static
					<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.declare</samp> function with their name. This helps SAPUI5
				to check at runtime whether a loaded module really contains the expected content
				(compare the required name against the declared name). As a side effect,
					<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.declare</samp> will ensure that the parent namespace of the
				module name exists in the current global namespace (window). More details can be
				found in the API documentation of declare. </p>
 
		<p class="p">If a module does not contain a declaration, the framework assumes that the module has the
				expected content and automatically declares it with the name used for loading it. In
				some rare cases - which are explained below - a module declaration is mandatory.</p>
 
		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Description</strong>: Furthermore, modules can contain a description which helps others to decide
				whether a module is useful for them, or not. By convention, any JavaScript comment
				preceeding a module's declaration (<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.declare</samp> statement) is
				interpreted as its description. The configuration UI displays such descriptions next
				to the module name.</p>
 
		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Dependencies</strong>: Last but not least, modules can use the
					<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp> method to load other modules that they
				depend on. While <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp> internally has the effect of a
				"loadModule" call, it can also be regarded as a dependency declaration (therefore
				its name 'require'). These dependency declarations can be evaluated at runtime (as
				explained above), but they can also be analyzed at built time or at runtime on the
				server. </p>
 
		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Example</strong>: </p>
 
		<p class="p">A typical module that uses all of the above features might look like this (the module name is
					<samp class="ph codeph">my.useful.SampleModule</samp>); </p>
 
		<div><pre class="pre codeblock">

   /*
    * A short documentation of the module. This documentation is not evaluated at runtime, only during build time
    */    
   jQuery.sap.declare("my.useful.SampleModule"); // declaration of the module. Will ensure that the containing namespace 'my.useful' exists.

   // list of dependencies of this module
   jQuery.sap.require("sap.ui.core.Core");
   jQuery.sap.require("some.other.Module");
   jQuery.sap.require("you.can.Also", "list.multiple.Modules", "if.you.Want");
   ...

   // create the 'main' object of the module
   my.useful.SampleModule = {};</pre></div>
 
	 </div></div>
<div class="section" id="loio91f23a736f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_3CE4E8CBC895413BAD43B189FBAFC7D2"><div class="section_title">Loading a Module</div><div type="Loading a Module"> 
		 
		<p class="p">As mentioned already, modules are loaded by calling function
					<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp> with the name of a required module. The
				framework then checks whether the named module is loaded already. If so, the
				function simply returns. Otherwise it tries to load and execute the module
				synchronously. If any of these two steps fails, an exception is thrown and execution
				of the calling module thereby is disrupted.</p>

			<p class="p">To summarize it: A call to <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp> ensures that the
				required module is loaded and has been executed before execution of the caller
				continues (*). (*) this is only true as long as no cyclic dependencies occur. </p>
 
		<p class="p">When loading a module, its dot-separated name must
		  be transformed to an URL. This is done by replacing all dots ('.') with slashes
		  ('/') and appending the standard suffix '.js' to it. This transformed name is
		  then appended to the UI5 resource root URL (a prefix of the URL where UI5 has
		  been loaded from, see explanation of bootstrap). The resulting URL is then used
		  to load the module as a text. If loading succeeds, the module is first declared
		  with the original module name and then executed in a global context (window).
		  If either loading the module or executing it fails, the module name is
		  internally marked as "failed" and an exception is thrown indicating the cause
		  for the failure. Any further tries to load the same module will fail
		  immediately, reproducing the same error message. 
		</p>
 
	 </div></div>
<div class="section" id="loio91f23a736f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_BB13FE115C734DC490D61C6E45AE648C"><div class="section_title">Multiple Module Locations</div><div type="Multiple Module Locations"> 
		 
		<p class="p">It is a common use case for web applications that different modules are located in different
				locations (servers, web apps). Imagine for example that your web application is
				deployed as an individual web app and that it contains some very important modules
				to be loaded at runtime. But for administrative reasons, SAPUI5 and its provided
				modules have to be loaded from a content delivery network (CDN) or from a centrally
				deployed web app. As explained above, SAPUI5 by default will try to load any
				required modules from its resource root URL, namely from the centrally deployed web
				application. This would fail for the modules contained in your web application. </p>
 
		<p class="p">Such mixed location scenarios are supported with
		  the 
		  <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.registerModulePath</samp>
		  function: 
		</p>
 
		<div><pre class="pre codeblock">   jQuery.sap.registerModulePath = function(sModuleNamePrefix, sURL);</pre></div>
 
		<p class="p">It associates a module name prefix with an URL
		  prefix. Any module whose name starts with the module name prefix will be loaded
		  from the registered URL instead of the standard resource root URL. In the
		  scenario prethought above, this can be used to redirect the request for the
		  application-specific modules to the corresponding web application: 
		</p>
 
		<div><pre class="pre codeblock">

   &lt;!-- bootstrap tag which implicitly defines the resource root as 'http://www.sap.com/sapui5/1.0/resources/' --&gt;
   &lt;script src="http://www.sap.com/sapui5/1.0/resources/sap-ui-core.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;

   &lt;script&gt;
      // request will be mapped to http://www.sap.com/sapui5/1.0/resources/sap/ui/core/Core.js
      jQuery.sap.require('sap.ui.core.Core'); 

      // redirect the 'my.webapp' package to the local web app
      jQuery.sap.registerModulePath('my.webapp', '/my-webapp/resources/my/webapp/');

      // loads /my-webapp/resources/my/webapp/MyModule01.js
      jQuery.sap.require('my.webapp.MyModule01');
   &lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>
 
		<div class="note note" id="loio91f23a736f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__note_N100D3_N100B1_N10013_N10001"><span class="notetitle">Note</span>  
		  <p class="p">The registered URL above contains the transformed module name prefix 'my/webapp/'. While this
					seems to be an unnecessary redundancy in the registration, it allows a more
					flexible packaging of the modules. For example, a company might decide to deploy
					all its specific modules named 'my.company.*' to the central URL
					'http://my.company/shared/' without packaging them into a two level hierarchy of
					subfolders: </p>
 
		  <div><pre class="pre codeblock">jQuery.sap.registerModulePath('my.company', 'http://my.company/shared/');</pre></div>
 
		</div>
 
		<p class="p">However, when the standard build tools of the
		  SAPUI5 framework are used, the full package name will be part of the runtime
		  file hierarchy and the registration must contain the transformed package
		  hierarchy as above. 
		</p>
 
	 </div></div>
<div class="section" id="loio91f23a736f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_4BF103BDCFB64467BCD4621E16054206"><div class="section_title">Dependency Resolution Tools</div><div type="Dependency Resolution Tools"> 
		 
		<p class="p">The previous section contained some explanations
		  how dependencies between modules are resolved on the client at runtime. During
		  development, this is the typical use case. Modules can be modified in the
		  development environment and can be deployed as individual entities to some
		  runtime. When the client then is refreshed - and if caching is configured
		  properly - it will reload only the modified modules. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">In productive systems however, it might be
		  desirable to bundle again several modules into one single file. This helps
		  reducing the number of necessary roundtrips and can thereby help to reduce the
		  impact of network latency. However, one doesn't want to loose the flexibility
		  and transparency of the dependency management. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">The SAPUI5 framework supports this with a dependency resolution tool. It analyzes a module file
				and all its dependencies and creates a new file containing the original module
				content, as well as any required modules. It automatically avoids double inclusion
				of modules. The tool can be used in two ways: Either via an Ant task at build time
				to create a merged super module which then can be referenced in any HTML page
				instead of the original file; or at runtime, then using a servlet on server side. </p>
 
	 </div></div>
<div class="section" id="loio91f23a736f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_B88837EDEC2B46019FFD329681554C97"><div class="section_title">How to Avoid Duplicates</div><div type="How to Avoid Duplicates"> 
		 
		<p class="p">When the runtime dependency resolution is used, the
		  runtime maintains a list of the loaded modules. Before a new module is loaded
		  and executed, the list is searched for it and if found, the module is not
		  loaded again. But when the server or build-time tool is used, it creates a
		  bigger file potentially containing multiple modules. The runtime then can only
		  check in advance whether that bigger module has been loaded already. It does
		  not know about the contained modules and therefore can not avoid double-loading
		  of them. To compensate this, the dependency resolution tool wraps any embedded
		  module with a few lines of additional coding. These additional checks will be
		  evaluated during execution of the merged module and will have the same effect
		  as the original runtime checks in an unmerged scenario: 
		</p>
 
		<div><pre class="pre codeblock">   ...

    // code of enclosing module 
    ...

    // location of a jQuery.sap.require('xyz');

    if ( !jQuery.sap.isDeclared('xyz') ) { // check whether module 'xyz' has been loaded already
      

        jQuery.sap.declare('xyz'); // will only be added if the module 'xyz' doesn't contain a declaration
    

        // original text of module 'xyz'
        ...
    }        

    ...
    // further code of enclosing module
    ...</pre></div>

		  contain a module declaration if the module doesn't contain one. The wrapper
		  avoids double loading no matter whether a module has been loaded as an
		  individual file or as part of a bigger, merged module. It is even possible to
		  recursively merge files (merged module A includes a merged module B).

		<p class="p">One might wonder why multiple modules can not
		  simply be concatenated into a bigger module. Why have the modules to be parsed
		  and to be nested according to the original 
		  <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp>
		  calls? The answer simply is that this makes the runtime behavior of the merged
		  file more predictable. As soon as you look at concrete modules with complex (or
		  even cyclic) dependencies, order of module execution becomes significant. The
		  main promise of 
		  <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp>
		  that the caller continues only after the required module has been successfully
		  loaded and executed can be hold only if the required module is embedded exactly
		  at the place where the 
		  <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp>
		  call was located. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">In cases where a use of the dependency resolution
		  tool is not possible at all, one might indeed simply concatenate modules. But
		  then the following two criteria must be ensured 'manually' by the developer: 
		</p>
 
		<ul class="ul"><li class="li">

		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">How to Load
			 jquery.sap.require? 
		  </strong> 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">Obviously, modules can only be loaded as soon as the jQuery.sap.require function is available.
				The implementation of this function is located in module 'jquery.sap.global' which
				in turn requires jQuery itself (located in module 'jquery-1.7.1'). At runtime, these
				two modules can not be loaded with 'jquery.sap.require' but must be loaded by some
				other mean. The SAPUI5 framework includes both modules in its bootstrap files
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-core.js</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-core-lean.js</samp>. The
				first one also embeds the SAPUI5 core functionality and needs no further modules.
				The second one only contains the two bootstrap modules and a require statement for
				the core. It is better suited for the development scenario described above (loading
				the modules separately). </p>
 
		<p class="p">If you create a new bootstrap file with the configuration UI and decide to include the
				jquery.sap.global or jquery modules, they always will be the first modules in the
				created file, and they will always be embedded. This ensures the availability of
					<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp>. </p>
 
		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cyclic
			 Dependencies</strong> 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">Sometimes, the functionality in two modules A and B might be interdependent. That means module
				A requires module B to execute and module B requires module A. We stated above that
					<samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp> ensures that the execution of a calling
				module doesn't continue until the required module has been loaded and executed.
				Taking this serious, cyclic dependencies could not be resolved but would lead to an
				endless series of requests (A-&gt;B-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;...). </p>
 
		<p class="p">This situation can be avoided by a workaround: As
		  soon as a module A has been loaded and is about to execute, it is regarded as 
		  <em class="ph i">declared</em>. So, when this module A
		  embeds another module B which has not been loaded, module B will be loaded and
		  executed. If B now again requires A, then the dependency resolution runtime
		  will find that A has been declared already (despite the fact that its execution
		  has not been finished yet) and simply returns. This workaround helps to break
		  the endless loop, but it doesn't re-ensure the original promise of 
		  <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.require</samp>. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">Cyclic modules have to deal with that gap on their
		  own. There are several ways/best practices how to do this: 
		</p>
 
		<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> 
			 <p class="p">Variant 1: Merge A and B 
			 </p>
 
			 <p class="p">If the conflicts can not be resolved easily, or
				if the modules are so highly related that they will be used together most of
				the time, then merging them into one module is the most simple solution. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
<li class="li"> 
			 <p class="p"> Variant 2: Interlaced Execution of A and B 
			 </p>
 
			 <p class="p">This variant makes use of the fact that the
				module loading takes place exactly at the source location where the
				jQuery.sap.require function is executed. Let's assume that the content of
				modules A and B can be structured as follows: 
			 </p>
 
			 <div><pre class="pre codeblock">// Module A, Part A.1
   

    // Module Section A.1, does not depend on Module B and provides all code that module B depends on.


    jQuery.sap.require("B");


    // Module Section A.2, might depend on code in Module Section B.1</pre></div>
 
			 <div><pre class="pre codeblock">// Module B, Part B.1
  

    // Module Section B.1, does not depend on Module A and provides all code that module A depends on.


    jQuery.sap.require("A");


    // Module Section B.2, might depend on code in Module Section A.1</pre></div>
 
			 <p class="p">Further assume (WLOG) that module A is loaded
				first. Then section A.1 will be executed and will be available to the outside
				world before the 
				<samp class="ph codeph">require('B')</samp> is
				executed. During the require, the framework will detect that B is not available
				yet, will load and execute it. The execution starts with section B.1 which
				succeeds as it does not depend on A. When the execution of B reaches the 
				<samp class="ph codeph">require('A')</samp>
				statement, the framework detects that A has been loaded already and continues
				without loading A again. But remember, that the code from section A.2 is not
				available yet. The execution of B however continues and succeeds as - by
				assumption - B.2 does not depend on A.2. Now, the first 
				<samp class="ph codeph">require('B')</samp>
				succeeds and returns and section A.2 will be executed. And it might use the
				code from section B.1. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
</ul>
 
		<p class="p">Procedure and result are similar in the case that B
		  is loaded first.
