<ul class="ul" id="loio497c27a8ee26426faacd2b8a1751794a__ol_lg1_zmt_mn"><li class="li">You adapt an existing theme by using the UI theme designer, which basically modifies the
				color scheme, but in a very easy, non-technical manner with instant live preview.
				Adaptation parameters are limited, but the UI theme designer also allows adding
				custom CSS, which gives the freedom to adapt basically everything.</li>
<li class="li">You adapt an existing theme by adding CSS on application level. This is the easiest
				option and still sufficient for many use-cases. One can technically adapt and change
				everything.</li>
<li class="li">Create a new theme from scratch, writing every piece of CSS which will be loaded
				later. The only requirement is to have <span class="ph filepath">library.css</span> files within
				a certain folder structure (which also defines the theme name).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">All options except the first result in a new standalone theme which needs to be deployed
			and referenced by its name in the application and which could be used by any
			application. In the second option, the adaptation is rather done on top of an existing
			theme and only available within the specific application.</p>
<p class="p">In all options the CSS developer could choose to limit the styling effort to those
			controls which are actually used in the application (which of course limits the re-use
			value of the theme in other applications).</p>

			<div class="p">There is not one single way to create a new theme, but there are several options.
				Which one to choose depends on several factors:<ul class="ul" id="loio497c27a8ee26426faacd2b8a1751794a__ul_cdq_jwp_qn"><li class="li">How different is the desired design from an existing theme?</li>
<li class="li">Should the theme be used across several applications or just in one?</li>
<li class="li">Are sufficient CSS skills available?</li>
<li class="li">How structured and clean should the result be?</li>
</ul>
</div>

			<p class="p">Depending on the answers it may be that one should not even create a new theme but
				just adapt an existing one.</p>
